## *Profile*
I started studying Web development in summer 2020 by taking [HTML and CSS Fundamentials](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:W3Cx+HTML5.0x+1T2020/course/) course. The first impression was more than great, I got extremely interested and decided to get acquainted with JavaScript. After that, my best friend advised me to join JavaScript/ Front-end course of the [Rolling Scopes School](https://rs.school/). It looked like a unique opportunity to learn everything free from basics till the advanced level and especially with the help of a mentor who would give feedback on my code. Now I am a student here and am convinced that this course, along with my efforts will boost my skills in Web development and open new and exciting career opportunities. I am a quick and persistent learner: if I start doing a task, I cannot rest until I finish it. I am also good at time management and know, how to work efficiently on my own, as well as in a team. *My profile will be updated in the next months.*
